1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,830
Not that we have the full structure of our server.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,520
We have the controls on the.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,630
We are going to start building or setting up our phones and with weapons.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,490
So let's go ahead and install by

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,080
and ISO Version 4.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,240
We need to also install wetbacks like

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:31,050
Next we'll create a Web site config file the first thing we're doing this far is require that EMV on

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,780
we'll call the config function.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,560
This is so we can use environment variables in our power configuration.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,900
For example when we want to know if the application is in production next number which import is the

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,350
path

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:54,280
our config is required to export an object and the default or the base configuration is an entry point.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:03,520
And this is going to be client slash index digits which is going to be the base for off just application.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,630
Then you're going to have an output the file name is going to be app.

15
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:22,940
Yes and the path is going to be path not resolve Durning server slash public.

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,800
That's go through these together.

17
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,650
What we want to do is we want to have a plan for the ship all of our clan code is going to leave it

18
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:37,780
which will have an index largesse which is the roots of our clients.

19
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:45,570
And when Web views our clan it's going to put the content or the output of the built into a public folder

20
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,330
in so rough order.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,320
And once this is put here we are also going to build the server and have maybe a disk for that with

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,630
the final outputs of our project which is what we are going to run in production.

23
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,870
So let me show you how this is going to work.

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,030
I'll open my particular Jason which so have a script called Build clients.

25
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,390
This is going to one Web Park mode equals production.

26
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,520
Remember it's always possible mode configuration because it's required by wetback.

27
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:25,010
Let's also make sure I went back on forecast the mode option which I see a process that EMV not load

28
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,960
EMV or development

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,460
which means if the model is not defined in the node environment we should just use development by default.

30
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,280
So we have a script called build plan and this is going to run weapon.

31
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:49,390
So let's run this on see what we have as output NPM one viewed science

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,100
if we check the public folder you can see we have an update just magnified file bundled and put there

33
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,830
by wetback.

34
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,170
So when rep builds a clan it is it in the public folder.

35
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,260
Now how do we finally send this code to production.

36
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:19,280
We are going to have a view serve our scripts and this is going to run Babu on the server for the and

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,070
we configured the output directory to the disk and we'll copy all of the files that and not JavaScript

38
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,500
files.

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:37,470
So the way this looks is if we want NPM on build server it's going to build all of the javascript from

40
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,480
the server folder and place it in this list and you can see right now this uses yes 5 which is the best

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,790
2 1 in production and also it also copy the app which is our clients.

42
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,020
So we build a client and then we build our server.

43
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,770
So let's just have a built create which is going to do both NPM run

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,060
view clans and build server

45
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:20,240
configuration at the moment can build our clients and place it in the public folder of the server and

46
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,000
we also have a bubble script to build our server and place it in a dist folder.

47
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:32,420
We probably should at this to get it now in the next lesson we'll continue preparing our client site.
