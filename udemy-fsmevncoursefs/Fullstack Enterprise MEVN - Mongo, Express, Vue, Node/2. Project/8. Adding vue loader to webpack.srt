1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,210
Let's add by bootloader you know that on VHS to application for wetbacks to be able to compare download

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:07,770
view files.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,860
We need to view loadout for Web site to be able to compare down yes six down to iOS 5 that the boss

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,360
understands we need to have.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,720
So npm install

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,800
view louder and louder to configuration load us.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:33,470
We are going to have our module key here would have rules and there's is going to be an array of all

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:43,560
US test is going to be a regular expression for fires and in the chest and in this case we would use

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,290
the bubble Ludo so for all fire spending we don't just use the bubble loadout and we'll have another

10
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,690
test and this is going to be for all fires and in our view in this case we are going to use

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,930
the view loader for The View low that's worked properly.

12
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,750
We also need to use the view Luda blogging.

13
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,610
So we are going to require this

14
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,580
registered to plug plugin.

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:35,820
Now if we run our application NPM on death web by comparison successfully but as a package we are missing

16
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,830
unfortunately able to detect that package.

17
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,100
I want to show how required it is we are going to add a dot view file to our product.

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:51,380
So I'm going to have a page's folder here on half of me the view in my index suggests I'm going to import

19
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,640
view from view.

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,300
Oh that's right.

21
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:06,620
We haven't installed you Sol stone view npm install safe you now create a new view instance.

22
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:15,510
We need to pass in the elements in this case up and we need to pass a render function what is going

23
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:22,320
to be when that when the few instances mount that we are going to render the main component.

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:31,830
So all important main form pages slash mean that you understand the function is going to taking that

25
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:42,090
creates an immense function called create elements on the meat or you're going to see really popular.

26
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,550
It's simply an etch like this.

27
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,580
This basically means render the main component.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,430
So we have a indexed Digest which mounts are main component and we I mean the view from another which

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,570
sets a wetback.

30
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,650
It's supposed to compile down the main The View and The Indexed digest and put them in a public folder.

31
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,430
Jess.

32
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,610
Let's try this out.

33
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:16,530
NPM one def and we have an error and this is the reason why I let this happen because I want you to

34
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,260
be able to read through the errors and detect exactly what you do.

35
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,220
For example in this case I specifically left out the package called view template compiler which is

36
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,610
a peer dependency for the view Luda.

37
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,930
So after reading this I want understanding exactly why weapon is really.

38
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:43,830
I know I have to install the view template compiler not I have this installed everything should be fine.

39
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:51,800
So NPM on Def serve us at that successfully and wetbacks successfully compound in our main let's add

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,590
a template here.

41
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:01,270
I'll have an etch one that sees the main components and in our public indexed with Eskimo instead of

42
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:08,530
having this patch one we're going to have a diff with ideas of how and when this javascript is low that

43
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:15,730
is going to Molins or render the main component on the element with idea of just like we describe.

44
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:23,560
So now if we visit local voice for three thousand upvotes so you can see we have the main component

45
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,900
and just like that we are successfully loading view Jess from our server site.
