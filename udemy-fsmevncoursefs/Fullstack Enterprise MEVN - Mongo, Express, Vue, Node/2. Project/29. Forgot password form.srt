1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,960
Let's set up the clan site form for requesting a password resets when they use obviously the logging

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,520
screen.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,140
And they are trying to logging.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,620
This should have a button that says forgot password.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,920
And if they click on it then they're presented with the form to request for a password we said link

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,790
first in the pages for that we are going to create a new page called forgot password.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,970
How do we get everything in the logging view and pasted there so we don't consume so much time.

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:40,880
This is going to be called forgotten password as the title is going to have only an e-mail feud and

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,110
this is going to see send password reset link

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,280
next.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,170
It's also going to use the form mixing.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:59,480
But this is going to receive an action called Post forgot password the model is only going to require

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:07,280
the email and on click of the button it's going to call a method called forgot password

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,560
next.

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:18,340
This method is going to be called forgot password is going to dispatch post forgot password action and

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,860
after the password has been sent.

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,970
This is not going to authenticate the user it's just going to push their use out to the home page.

18
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,860
And if there are any errors it's just going to said that I was on the phone just like we've been doing.

19
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:44,280
OK now we need to define this action so we'll go to our store actions and export constant post forgot

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,080
password.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,860
Let's define the action

22
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,410
and it's going to make a post request to slash passwords.

23
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,390
Slash e-mail and we'll pass the data from the phone.

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,100
Now we have to go to the logging and include a button or a link to the forgot password beach.

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:16,710
So right before the signing button which will have a div with a margin up and down all five and it's

26
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,690
going to have a Waltzer link

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,860
that says forgot password.

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll give this a class of no on the line of text Brown and text center and also this is going to go

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,780
to auth slash passwords slash e-mail.

30
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,870
Now we need to register the rout for the forgot password speech.

31
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:56,820
So in our Welch file which are the new out path is going to be of passwords email and we need to import

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,600
that component

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,440
and we'll pass it down to the component property.

34
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,350
OK so let's try this out.

35
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,390
We have an error that sees no matching and talk.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,140
And I think that's because we didn't close the routing link here.

37
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,740
Great.

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,180
So now we have the forgot password link Perth for some reason it's not centralised with the text center.

39
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:36,520
Let's try this out in the def dos have text center we can centralize this with Flex box by giving these

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:45,340
a class of flex and justify sensor in the logging.

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to remove the texts and to give this a margin way of eight for most species.

42
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,860
Give this a display of flex justify sensor on items sensor.

43
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,520
Great.

44
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:10,460
So now if I click on forgot password it takes me to the forgot password beach where I can type and request

45
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:17,040
for a password reset link so if I check my network and I make that request we obviously receive a 4

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,660
or 4 from the API telling us this world does not exist in the next lesson we are going to define this

47
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,680
well and take care of the server side of this functionality.
