1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,070
So always keep our quote cleanly formatted.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,150
That's in store preshow npm install save.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,370
Def creature

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,830
we can have a preacher our c file and this is going to contain all of the configurations that we want

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,090
for preacher.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,220
Personally I like the top with of four also I can make sure that semicolon is set to false because I

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,820
prefer writing code without semicolons.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,810
I can also set single quotes too true.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,590
So that looks cleaner.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,080
There's a ton of configurations that you can have for preacher.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,410
This is the ones I like to work with in package the Jason.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,820
We're going to add a new script that we can use to rapidly format our code.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,590
This is going to be called preacher here.

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,400
We're going to have the preacher man dash dash right so that when preacher formats the code he's going

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:08,700
to see the changes and we are going to have all the flowers and in the Jeffs in the coin folder to be

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,200
formatted.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:19,060
So let's try this one NPM one preacher and if we check out you can see that the config was formatted

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,210
for us you can also check out a controller.

19
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,810
It was automatically formatted as record.

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,340
We are always going to run creature to make sure that our code is cleanly formatted and presentable.
