1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,190
There is some duplication we have in some of our pages for example in the logging page.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:14,360
We have the toggle loading function and we have the data loading property just because we want the button

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,030
to have a loading stage in the register.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,720
We have exactly the same thing but as the application grows and we have more and more forms we do not

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,400
want these to be duplicated.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,620
So we are going to create a mixing with a mixing

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,560
we can compost this data in one place so export default and object

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,940
first would you find a data property and he's going to have a looting state of force.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,340
And second would define a method property

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:01,210
and he's going to have toggle loading function saw pasted there.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,480
Now we are going to come to our register did you delete this toggle loading function and also delete

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,460
our data.

13
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,920
Looting property and we're going to import this mixing

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,020
from clients make sense slash form and we are going to use it on these components.

15
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,660
So makes sense for mixing we are going to do exactly the same thing in the logging.

16
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:36,910
So I'll delete loading remove toggle loading and import the mixing

17
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,480
and use it.

18
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,930
Now that this is done let's go to our register form and see if it's true of some suspected or we have

19
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,420
some errors on I think that's because the name of this folder is supposed to be mixed since we named

20
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,080
that and if we check our allies again we are good to go.

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,870
So let's try to register pass in a name pass in an email

22
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,550
and a password.

23
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,610
If I click on sign up we still have the loading state successfully but our registration process does

24
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,630
not stop loading.

25
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:32,430
And I think I know why a couple of lessons back when we dealt with the validation we didn't call next.

26
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,860
When everything is fine.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,310
So remember to return or call next when the validation succeeds.

28
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,730
So let's just try this one more time to make sure that the registration process is all right.

29
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,360
So we're passing the fake name on a password

30
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,410
and great.

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,850
We redirect that to the home page which means everything is OK.
