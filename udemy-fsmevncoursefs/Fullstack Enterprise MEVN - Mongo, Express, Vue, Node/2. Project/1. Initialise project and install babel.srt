1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,650
The first step to starting a full spectroscopy project is to generate a package that Jason for NPM.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,780
In each dash why this automatically skips all questions.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:19,410
The next step is for us to install Express which is our backend server npm install safe.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,400
EXPRESS

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:32,060
next year I'm going to do is create a get ignore file so that we can make sure unnecessary folders and

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,100
files are not pushed to get hot going to ignore the non modules and the puckish log.

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:44,320
The Jason File next I'll create a server folder where all of our server code is going to live.

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,960
Now create an indexed or just file you need which is I wrote in here going to require express

9
00:00:54,110 --> 00:01:01,950
create a new express instance my calling express as a function and we can listen or create a server.

10
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,620
My calendar listen function.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,330
We need to pass in the port as a first argument and the second argument is a function that will be executed

12
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,610
once our server has successfully started.

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,500
In this case I'm just going to log server started

14
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,280
to execute this far.

15
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,930
We can run node server slash index and you can see we have servers not that because expressed server

16
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,070
was successfully started at the moment.

17
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,840
If we make any changes to this file we would have to stop our server and started again before we see

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,730
those changes.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:46,090
But we are going to install a tool code load month so we don't have to do this npm install save us a

20
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,960
dependency for development Node 1

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,730
now that we have no money stored no packets should use and file our create a script and this script

22
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,630
is going to be called

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:17,720
this script is going to unload on server slash index and if we want NPM 1 def you can see we have server

24
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:26,150
started now load money is going to automatically restart every time we make a change.

25
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,010
The next step is for us to be able to use the ESD import syntax instead of the require.

26
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:39,080
This is going to really keep our code very clean and things are clean site all so uses the ASX require

27
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,060
the server side should also use it for uniformity.

28
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:49,230
To do this we are going to install a couple of bubble packages and then install save.

29
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:55,060
Def the first one is going to be bubble core and this is the core bubble package.

30
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,450
The second one is going to be bubble slash CLIA which we are going to use to transpire that yes 6 quote

31
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,930
down to yes five so that we can run in production the next one is bubble slash preset EMV.

32
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,320
So that bubble can detect what specific version of JavaScript we are using and compile down to the correct

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:24,400
one last one is bubble node which is the package we are going to use along side note Hmong in development

34
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,640
now that those packages saying start the first thing we are going to do is modify our normal script.

35
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:42,220
I'm going to add exact bubble note and instead of using old look money is going to use my note so that

36
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,790
it transpires down to yes 5 before executing the code.

37
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,650
The next thing we're going to do is create a dot bubble.

38
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:57,120
Our CFO and inhere we are going to define a preset and the preset is going to be bubbles slash preset

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,980
Ian.

40
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,530
So that bubble automatically detects what version of Jaws we are using.

41
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:11,530
Now if we come to our call we can change this to import Express from Express and now let's go ahead

42
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:20,530
on one NPM one def to see if mobile is able to transfer our code and pin on Def and we have an error

43
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,930
that space express is not defined.

44
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,440
That's because we change data capital.

45
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,050
Great.

46
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,900
You can see that look monies successfully able to run could be the iOS 6 import syntax.

47
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:37,410
Now that we have both sets of we successfully sets our bubble and installed express let us continue

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,750
in the next lesson.
