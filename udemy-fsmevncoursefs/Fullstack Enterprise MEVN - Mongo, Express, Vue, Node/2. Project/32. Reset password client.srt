1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,370
Let's set up the reset password beach first.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,650
We'll create a component

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,310
next.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:16,820
With registered around on this path all this wealth has to match exactly what we sent in the email so

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,960
we can visit the e-mail and see the path so the path is off.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,490
Passwords reset.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:29,530
So we want to maintain that and the component is reset password

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,170
and make sure the component is important.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,070
This component is going to be almost like the log in so copy everything from the logging on paste in

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,760
The Reset.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,490
So this is going to see reset your password.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,380
This form is only going to need an input field for password.

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:01,520
So this is going to be password and this is going to say until your new password and we are not going

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,640
to need a forgot password link.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:16,360
And this is going to see resets password and our click is going to call a method called reset password.

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:23,460
It's also going to use the form mix in it's only going to need the password field the method is going

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,010
to be called reset password.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,170
And the action is going to be post reset password.

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,080
Then when we are making the EPA request to reset the password we are not only going to send this dog

20
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,330
model we are going to send this to the model and we have to send the token that is in the power meter

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,020
so you can see off passwords reset and then we have a token.

22
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,950
So this took in this part of the world.

23
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:58,290
So we have to define this as a dynamic well with the idea dynamic field here or we can call these tokens

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:05,140
since that's what it is then in the reset password when we are making the API request we can add the

25
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,670
token in the body of the request.

26
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:16,300
And that's what is going to be this note about the programs that token then when we receive a successful

27
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,260
response we are going to stop looting.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,080
We are not going to set off but we would redirect the user.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:31,900
So this data out the push to the home page then if there are any errors will do exactly the same error

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,020
handling.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,920
OK so let's see that in action.

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,360
If I refresh your speech.

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,970
Great.

34
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,940
That's our reset password form.

35
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,070
We can pass in our new password and then click on reset at the moment.

36
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,040
If we click on resets we're going to have some errors because we have anything else defined our action.

37
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,100
So let's define the action we come to store actions.

38
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,460
We're going to export.

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,720
Constant reset password.

40
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:11,490
And this is going to be an action receives context on data and simply returns clan the post to the end

41
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:21,110
point for resetting password asked passwords resets and it passes the data from the form and these data

42
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,880
also contains the token from the euro.

43
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,130
So let's try this again.

44
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:36,340
Plus password and it looks like we have another error or data is not defined.

45
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,300
Let's check this out.

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,540
And that's because I have a typo here.

47
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,560
Sorry about that.

48
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,580
Let's try this one more time and great.

49
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,200
We have 0 4 0 4 and not fun for my server because we haven't yet defined this end point in the next

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,590
lesson.

51
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,510
We are going to handle resetting the user's password on the server.
