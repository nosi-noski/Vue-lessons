1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,330
That's in store till when CSX reaches the CSX from what we are going to be using for this project.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,530
If you've never used to before it's really really easy to use and you're going to have an opportunity

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,320
to learn the most amazing CSX framework on the planet.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,320
The first thing we need to do is install a couple of dependencies.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,870
First we'll be installing two having CSX itself but we'll also need to install post CSX which is which

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,900
will help us compare advanced CSX to what most bosses can understand.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,860
We'll also need to install post CSX loader so he can help load that advance CSX with Westpac.

8
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,720
And I think that's all we need.

9
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:54,830
Next we are going to generate a tail CSX configuration file by running and p x to win in it and this

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,150
initialize the tool window.

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:04,480
Jess we see here next we're going to have a configuration for post CSX so CSX can feed the Jets.

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,650
And here we're going to have a module that exports and it's going to have a plugins ins and one of them

13
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:24,380
is going to be require showing CSX and will pass in showing that Jess has a config.

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,310
Now don't worry so much about CSX and all of the configurations.

15
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:35,690
What you need to know is this is a configuration for loading CSX and we need to register till we plug

16
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,000
it so that CSX is going to know exactly what configurations to use.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,290
And we also have to add the post CSX loadout to our weapon configuration so that you can compare than

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,310
that advanced JavaScript we talked about.

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,630
So how are CSX loader.

20
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,450
Now the final step is to be able to use Tobin says sensors in our own CSX.

21
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,920
So in our client stars mean CSX.

22
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,860
When you use the towing CSX.

23
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:13,320
So we in pre-flight to lean components.

24
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:25,160
And finally till we utilities and this is different CSX packages coming from the till we package itself.

25
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,120
So because we have the tailwind plugging this directive is available to us and CSX knows how to handle

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,030
this company down to normal CSX.

27
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,020
So now that we have this if we check out the application it's to run in normally.

28
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:48,990
So if we refresh and view the beach source and view the update CSX look at that we have normal isotopes

29
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,600
yeses.

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,820
And this is coming from.

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,330
So when pre-flight we have a bunch of each meeting classes a lot of CSX and this is coming from the

32
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,280
CSX framework we just installed.

33
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,140
OK.

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,670
So how is this going to work to win helps us right.

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,570
Flexible CSX using utility classes.

36
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:18,350
And this is how it's going to work in the main the view we can give this element a class of text center.

37
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:26,090
This is text align center text seal which is color of teal and if I refresh.

38
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:26,620
Great.

39
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,640
You can see it's centralized and we have a color of teal and the awesome part about this framework is

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,890
the fact that every census we write is exactly the same way we would have written it if we were writing

41
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,240
this yes's directly.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,720
So you can see text you gives it a color of 2 and text sense I guess it takes a line of center just

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,890
like we would have written it.

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,750
OK.

45
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,060
Don't worry you're going to know a lot about this.

46
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,630
Yes from what as time goes on.

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,010
Thank you so much and see you in the next lesson.
