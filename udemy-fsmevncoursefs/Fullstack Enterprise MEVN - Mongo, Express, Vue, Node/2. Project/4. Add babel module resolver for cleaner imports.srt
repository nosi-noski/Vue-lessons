1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,680
If we check out our application we can see that importing files requires us to use the dot dots right

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,130
here.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,010
This is not very clean and we are going to use a bubble blogging to help us import files cleanup to

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,590
install this would run npm install safe def bubble plug in modules over

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,510
once this is installed.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,100
We need to configure it in our bubble.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,220
Our CFO.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,950
So we'll have plugins and inhere would have an array for mods to resolve.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,770
Which takes in on objects.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,890
Would define define the words which is the woods folder.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,410
And finally would define aliases that are going to be used to our application.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:55,010
The first I'm going to define is control us and this is going to go to server slash controllers and

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,770
what this means is every time we write controllers in an application bubble is going to know to look

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,770
into the server slash controllers folder.

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,840
Let's try with our off.

16
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,660
We can change this to controllers and try to start our application

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,240
we can see that it successfully starts because mobile is still able to load that file.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,940
This is a much cleaner way of using or importing fast application.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,180
Let's add one for the config.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
And one for the mouse.

21
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:44,280
To differentiate the aliases that we have from the normal load modules we can have an odd symbol right

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,600
here.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,320
Just to put a little difference between the two.

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,790
So here we can have a controllers in an index of the Jets.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:59,870
We can replace these with droughts and this type config you can see that bubble steer successfully restarts

26
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,820
because it understands exactly how to produce farms as we built along the coast.

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,760
We agreed to add more resources as need be.
