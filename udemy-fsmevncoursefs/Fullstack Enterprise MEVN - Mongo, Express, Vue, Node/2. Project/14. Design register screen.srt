1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,470
We'll be designing this queen in this lesson.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,100
But before we do that let's do some more work on this button.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:13,700
I'm going to introduce a couple of things to you so first instead of giving this a P. one I'm going

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:24,650
to give this a p x three and a P Y off to definitely looks better than what I want is when they use

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,330
a whole vase over this button.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:34,470
You should actually have a darker brown so the way you define effects with the win is 2 1/2 over a on

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,960
and then the stars that you want to be applied when they use a Hoovers for example.

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,040
Text Brown darkest should be the text.

9
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,360
So if I Hoover you can see that the text changes so I can also change the border.

10
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:59,670
So Hoover butter brown darkest and if I Hoover now you can see the whole thing changes.

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,530
Let's also make sure the logo is a link so I'm just going to change these two on a.

12
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:13,620
Or actually a Walton link so that it navigates recline side while chin and chew is going to be the homepage

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,570
and we'll say no on the line so that it's not decorated and it works.

14
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,940
Now let's go to the register peach in the register view.

15
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,350
First we're going to have a container on the container.

16
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,970
Basically restricts the width of contents.

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,390
So if I give a body to this container on the height so I'm just going to say with full so that it has

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,370
a full with then at 12:00.

19
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:49,090
And by brown red you can see that the container on the screen fills the whole screen.

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,450
But if I increase a screen you can see that the container just feels a part of the screen.

21
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:01,290
OK now I'm going to give this container an M X auto for my Jean Auto.

22
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,110
So that it's centralized and you can see on this screen is centralized.

23
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,560
But on smaller screens it fills the whole screen.

24
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,370
OK.

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,880
So that's a really good responsive container.

26
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,990
Next we're going to have this cart that we see.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,750
So we're going to have this section and that is in the container so I'll quit a leave Max with small.

28
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,640
And this gives the diff a max width and you can check.

29
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,680
So when she says to see

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,010
what small represents that's 30 REM.

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:52,180
So Max with of 30 m m ex auto background white etched twelve so if I expand this you can see this is

32
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,930
it covering this area of the container.

33
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,810
So we are just using height and color right now to play with this.

34
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,470
Let me just give these background green so we can see better.

35
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,990
So you can see the background green there.

36
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:14,250
So that's our max with small probably want to try Max with extra small that's smaller.

37
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,300
So I think we're going to go with this.

38
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,750
So in this container we are going to have an each one the text center.

39
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,720
And this is going to see register OK.

40
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:33,660
And remember the color has to be gold based on our makeup and I think that sex is to be competitive

41
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,140
makeup.

42
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,810
So maybe we want to reduce this to edge for Yeah that's too small.

43
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,310
Let's try and edge too.

44
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,820
And if it's too big we're going to UCSF to reduce it.

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,470
So she thinks it's too big.

46
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,350
We're going to give this a text of large and I think that's perfect.

47
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:03,340
So we can also give this container a margin why of 16 so that it is a little far away from the top.

48
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,600
Now let me remove the colors and the heights.

49
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,340
We do need that.

50
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,330
I mean more and the next thing we need to do is add our quite card.

51
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:19,780
So after the head you're going to have a container of with for that background.

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,880
Right.

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,640
And let's just give this a choice so we can design it maybe change by quality green.

54
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,260
Yeah.

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,380
So that's our day.

56
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,700
So the problem is the background blends with the background of the peach.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,180
So the diagram of the peach is actually not supposed to be white.

58
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,570
Right.

59
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,550
So that the background white of this element actually shows up and the background of the peach.

60
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,220
I'm going to define it in I mean that CSX.

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,130
So I already have defined.

62
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,690
You're just going to have it available.

63
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,660
So I'm just gonna see body and background.

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,910
Is this really light cream color right here.

65
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,410
So F E F the FAA.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:07,230
So now if we come back to the register and make this background of white and give this a shadow large

67
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,000
great you can see the background of white is a little visible.

68
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,570
So maybe this should just be a shadow.

69
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,470
And that's good enough.

70
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,200
So I don't know if you can notice but a background for the body is a little different because of the

71
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,540
styling be added.

72
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,870
OK.

73
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,570
So now let's give this a margin top of five just so that it's a little way from the head.

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,650
And let's give this a round that class just so that it has a little nice buttery juice and the battery

75
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,710
juice looks a bit too much for me.

76
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,460
So I'm going to reduce that you assume.

77
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,500
Great.

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,270
So round that.

79
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:44,820
Awesome.

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,650
Ok so now in our cart we are going to have inputs.

81
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,530
OK.

82
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,690
So this is our input.

83
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:04,680
Let's give it a couple of classes with full force starts us and you can see that's our input right there.

84
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:13,590
And if we want the contents of the car to be restricted we can give it a padding so we can say p. 6

85
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,520
and if we check the input now it's centralized somehow but because of the height we put it's messed

86
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,790
up.

87
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,220
Let's move the height and now you can see it's perfectly centralized.

88
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:32,250
We probably want to give this p off because this like a lot of putting from the template.

89
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,210
Yes.

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,580
Now we are going to have some more styling for the input.

91
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:48,400
We're going to give this a background of Brown the lightest and that's the color of the input box in

92
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,040
our template.

93
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,580
Then we want to give this a putty so that the input is really large.

94
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,070
So p y 0 5.

95
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,670
And that's a little much.

96
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,260
Let's try three.

97
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,430
And I think that's perfect.

98
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:08,170
BURT We don't want this this blue border our input so we're going to see for.

99
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,180
So that's the focus date outline should be known.

100
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,610
And if I click on that you can see the outline is no bird.

101
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,980
We also don't want the text in the input tree luck.

102
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,480
We actually want it to be brown.

103
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:30,940
So why wouldn't you say text Brown and we also want who is zones are putting in the input like that.

104
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,270
So we probably won't actually use P 3.

105
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,580
So that each horizontal and vertical like that.

106
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,540
And then I think the text in the input such really really large.

107
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,520
So we probably want to use text small maybe try to text extra small.

108
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,340
Yeah.

109
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,620
And I think that's perfect.

110
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,200
Okay guys.

111
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,430
So now let's out of place holder to see if it actually looks like a template.

112
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,600
So enter your name.

113
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,170
Great.

114
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,400
So that's our name.

115
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,910
So you can see how easy it is to actually design this thing with tail win.

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,470
We are just actually writing CSX.

117
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,320
Yes.

118
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,560
So now let's duplicate the input for email and password so I'll duplicate this

119
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,520
into your email and enter your password.

120
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,060
Burt we also need a matching bottom so that they are spaced out so Margene bottom of five margin bottom

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,010
of five.

122
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,580
Great.

123
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,080
That's the speech we need maybe a little too much on the padding.

124
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,580
So I'm just gonna give this a party of eight and the margin shouldn't be that much modern.

125
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,860
Bottom of three should be enough.

126
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,780
And finally let's at the bottom.

127
00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:01,620
So here I'm gonna have a button and let's give this a couple of classes with four so that it spans the

128
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,130
whole container.

129
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,690
And this is going to see sign up and let's give it a margin.

130
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:17,180
So Margene top off three so that it speaks and then let's give it a putting y of four and let's give

131
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,550
this a background of Emerald which is the name of a really nice blue color.

132
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:29,060
So why don't we give this budding white or three and it actually should be the same pattern with the

133
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,880
input boxes.

134
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,800
Right.

135
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:39,560
And then let's give this a text of white and let's give these around that small so that it's a little

136
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,630
rounded but not so obvious.

137
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,380
And let's remove the outline for a course outline known.

138
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,310
So if I click on that there's no outline.

139
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,430
And let's give this over states.

140
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,340
So whoever background should be Emerald lighter.

141
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,300
And if I refresh try to Hoover you can see it's light.

142
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,340
But we should actually use light instead of lighter.

143
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,300
Great.

144
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,740
So the text in the bottom looks really large.

145
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:20,890
So I probably wanna do text small and I think it's too large because of my enlargement but anyway.

146
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,560
That's fine.

147
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,750
OK.

148
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,180
So that's our design.

149
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,050
We have our richest touch screen completely design and just like that.

150
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,760
OK.

151
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,880
So I think that design is ready we can go ahead and use this.
