1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,220
Every good application should have such a confirmation box when the user has not confirmed your email.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,900
Let's build our own so that the user can confirm your emails by clicking on this link.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,980
So first we need to start this.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,260
We are going to go to the main view and looking at this.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,520
It's directly above the bar we have which is this and it looks like the text is centralized.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,490
It has a whiff of fool.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,250
It spans the whole container and has a little height on the text essentially aligned vertically and

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,230
horizontally.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:44,890
So let's try that before this would have a diff with a full with a height of about 12 the text is going

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,010
to be brown.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:54,360
The background is going to be good light test and the display is going to be flex.

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,210
The items are going to be sense centered

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,040
fiscally and justify center.

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,440
Now would you place in our text

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,490
please confirm your account.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,160
And it looks like we're getting there.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,870
The last thing we need is a link so the user can click on.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,300
Let's look at the design.

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,700
It looks like it's just a text with an on the line so we probably can fix that.

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,110
Let's try this first.

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,830
I just wanted to type out all of the text and this part which is supposed to be on the line.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:45,740
I'm going to give it the spawn and I'll give it a class on border and murder but on Brown and if we

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,870
look at that it's not the best.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:57,620
Probably want to give this mother too and maybe Mother button too so that the motor I is only on the

25
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:05,810
bottom and maybe give this a margin left of two now that color is not very visible.

26
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:13,940
Let's try the brown darkest student and change and I think that's because we are defining bottom on

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,090
the color.

28
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,150
That's not needed.

29
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,110
So let's try with Von great so we have please confirm your email address and receive an email.

30
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,480
Click here to send email.

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,570
Now that we have the design let's give this across all pointer so that each more user friendly friendly.

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,430
Now if I hover right I have a pointer.

33
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,720
You can go ahead and give it some more styling.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:48,490
Like on hole var the text should be brown dark est and when we hope VI you can see the text changing

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,630
on clique of this.

36
00:02:51,910 --> 00:03:01,900
So I'm going to give a click what we want is to re send e-mail confirm we can define this method in

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,220
this mean or the view.

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,080
But I like to keep it clean.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,670
I'll go to the off mixing and also define a new method they're called Reset IMO confirm for this we

40
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:20,440
are going to require a new action so I'm going to define an action called post re send email confirm

41
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,780
good to the actions and define it there.

42
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,340
First we have to export it

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,940
and next we have to define the matching action

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,730
or receive context and data.

45
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:50,100
So this is going to be client post to the off emails we send.

46
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,410
I will pass the data.

47
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,350
OK.

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,240
At the moment we are just passing data but as we did this summer side you're going to see we don't actually

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,430
require this.

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,520
First let's go to the mixing and make sure we dispatch this.

51
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,550
So this that stall the dispatch post we sent send email confirm an NDA.

52
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,500
Then we can redirect the user to the homepage and when there's an error they're still going to be X

53
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,480
to use.

54
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,250
That's the homepage.

55
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,910
The reason why we have a dot then until catches because we are going to be flushing different messages

56
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,320
and we want to put them in separate blocks.

57
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,640
OK so this is the setup for sending the e-mail confirmed for this user in the next lesson.

58
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,090
We are going to set up the server side to receive this request.
