1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,970
Let's at Hope module replacement mental application.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,050
The first thing we need to do is install what I call me the way.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,090
Next we'll go to our server indexed to chess.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,670
We're going to import this meta way

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:28,700
then we need to use this midway app to use my part called me to it and we'll pass in the compiler.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,960
Now we need to figure out what definitely the way to use hot model reloading.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,220
So we'll pass on a hot option and such a true.

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,640
Next we need to configure a weapon in the weapon file.

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:49,270
We're going to order new entry for Hotmail the replacement on these entries which going be wetback parts

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,880
middleware slash client where we load is equal to true.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,980
And this is the end point to also communicate with to get the new server updates.

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,030
Finally we need to register the weapon put me to where logging and that comes from wetback.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:17,620
So would require wetback and down to the plugin section will add a new wetback dot hearts module replacement

14
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,840
plugin.

15
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,750
Now let's start a server NPM one death

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:34,850
wetback successfully compilers reset or three thousand inspect to see if outmoded looting is activated

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,210
and there it is.

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,260
It works.

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:43,670
So now if we go to the mainland you can change logging to signing

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,360
we see that reflected immediately in the device in the browser.

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:58,730
So we have what module replacement walking now I'm going to visit the register speech and this is the

22
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,670
register speech.

23
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,370
And notice the path has changed.

24
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:08,570
It's no longer the home path buddies off slash register and now I'm going to go to the register the

25
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:14,950
view and change these to sign up bird.

26
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:21,490
We have an arrow when the boss tries to get the new update it receives an Unexpected token.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,220
And the reason for this is because let me show you.

28
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,280
If we go to network

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:38,680
and make a change and such for the server update which is this far and look at the response you can

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,650
see that instead of receiving a javascript file we actually receive a statement.

31
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:50,450
And the reason for this or the reason why the hope module package cannot find the javascript file is

32
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,550
looking for it is because we haven't defined our public path correctly.

33
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,600
So this is what we do in our web Pachter config agree to come to output and we are going to define public

34
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,490
path.

35
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,440
And this is going to be slash referring to the past.

36
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:08,820
Right.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah.

38
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,430
Server slash public and everything else from day on now go to indexed.

39
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:22,400
Jess I will define the public path for our web back for me the way this is going to be where parking

40
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:31,760
Feig done output dot public bus and now let's try this again.

41
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:41,070
We agreed to visit the home page visit the Red you stop and go back to register and try to change this

42
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,540
to register.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,440
Give that a few seconds and we have another problem.

44
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,300
Everytime we refresh the beach all the other worlds apart from home do not walk correctly.

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,980
And that is because in our index that s GMO we are not correctly referencing the assets.

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,110
So our slush is gonna be fine.

47
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,190
We don't need to add a dot.

48
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,320
So if I refresh it is great.

49
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:14,210
This works called module replacement is on and if I change register to sign up we can see that sign

50
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,690
up automatically reflects.

51
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,980
Which means what module replacement walks correctly for all kinds of wows because we successfully and

52
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,200
perfectly configured the parts.
