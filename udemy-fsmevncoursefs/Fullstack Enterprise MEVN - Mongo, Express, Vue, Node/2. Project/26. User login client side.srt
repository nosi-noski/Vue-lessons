1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,380
Let's create a logging form first in the client pages in the log in the view.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,830
I'm just going to copy everything in the register.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,530
So we do not waste so much time.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,170
Then the chop I'll change the title it's logging and we don't need the name input.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,490
All we need is the e-mail and the password.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,780
So now if we vitiate application and visited the logging screen we already have our form.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,250
Let's change the text.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:37,270
Like the signing text will change it to signing and when the button is clicked we are going to call

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:46,140
a method called logging and the model is not going to have a name it's going to receive a post logging

10
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,930
action and the method is going to be called logging

11
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:02,430
and it's going to dispatch an action code post logging when it's successful it's going to do exactly

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,770
the same thing to logging the user.

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,010
And when it fails it does exactly the same thing to handle the errors.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:17,550
But we need to define the post logging action so we're going to come to start off actions and export

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:32,230
a new constants post logging and we'll define the action.

16
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:40,130
This is simply going to make a post request to the author slash logging end point and you pass the data.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,120
Now let's try this out.

18
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:51,300
Let's open up a developer tools so we can monitor what's happening will pass in my email and if I click

19
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,130
on signing we have an enforceable entity seen the password is a request for you.

20
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,580
Let's check out the head us and it looks like the email and password are correctly past to the server.

21
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,460
So why is it telling us the password is a required field.

22
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,200
Let's check our validator again.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,940
So in our value dates are for logging

24
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:25,550
it looks like we didn't pass request that Buddy to our logging schema validates also it doesn't validate

25
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,440
the right data.

26
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:34,460
So let's try again to logging and if I click on logging it also has these credentials do not match our

27
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:42,470
records because my password is wrong and now if I pass in the correct password you can see that it returns

28
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,690
a successful 200 we'd use a token and a user password and if we check out our low cost of each it persists

29
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,530
that low cost of each.

30
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,410
And if we check out a view each store.

31
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,140
We also have that data.
