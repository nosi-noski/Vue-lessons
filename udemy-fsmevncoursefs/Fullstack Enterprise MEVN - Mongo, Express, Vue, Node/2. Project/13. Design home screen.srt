1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,580
This is a template we are going to be following and we need to design this week to we CSX.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,700
So let's get started now.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,380
We are going to learn a lot about who wins SS in the process.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:21,070
First let's talk about the call us if we go to the main that view and I give this a class of text to

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,600
you.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,050
You can see that this becomes green.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,230
Each color.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,490
Now where is this color code to come in for and tell me the gems file.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,180
It spots an object and in this object there is a class object and this defines all of the colors that

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,720
we are going to be using in our application.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,670
So the team color is defined here.

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,490
We have to which is the one we are using.

13
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,310
And then we have different shapes of two.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,530
So we have to light us to light and so on and so forth.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:04,400
And then anytime we have the text we can attach the name of the color that we want to give to this element.

16
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:12,550
So we have text you we can have text read since we have the red color defined in our til we see SS config.

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,580
We can have text blue if we want.

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,750
In this case for our design we have a brown each color.

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:27,650
We have a good each color and for the buttons if we check out the other designs we have a greenish color.

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,450
So this is going to be available to you.

21
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,870
I'm just going to go to my two weeks yeses and paste these colors.

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,700
So we have em out which is the greenish color.

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,120
We have gold which is the gold color and Brown which is the brownish color.

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,940
So now we can use these custom colors in our application.

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,710
So for example we can see text gold and you can see we have that good color right there.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,420
So now that we have our own custom color palette and the where you can actually get these.

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,760
OK so you can check the source code for this lesson and you just copy this palette that I pasted.

28
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,820
I prepared it beforehand.

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:14,810
Next thing we're going to take care of is the funds so funds that could come and we want to search for

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,080
merry weather.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:28,070
So this is the funds when you add the funds customize it add a bold and other light and I'll copy the

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:35,880
import coming to my main dot CSX and paste the import there.

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,830
So now that I have the Merriweather forms I can come to my towing CSX and configure these funds.

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,770
So if you search for funds in this configuration file you can see that we have funds and then we have

35
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:54,290
the name of the funds and then the order in which this form sheet should be loaded so we can add our

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,600
own funds if we want.

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,780
We have signs we have Sunseri We have money.

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,090
Let's add our own.

39
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,840
This is going to be primary and this is going to be Merriweather at the top which means everyone wants

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,850
to buy my font.

41
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,210
We are going to give it a colossal font primary.

42
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:23,110
So let's try that funds primary and if I call now you can see that this has a font of primary which

43
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,240
is r Merryweather fonts.

44
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:32,040
So let's just make sure that all elements on the page have this font so goods our index that estimable

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,930
and add this to the body class of funds primary.

46
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:38,890
OK.

47
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,480
That works.

48
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,000
We have the font configured.

49
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,700
Let's start taking care of our layout.

50
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,640
Looks like we need a top bar with this gold ish color in our main that view.

51
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,470
I'm going to add a DPH with a class of etch to an edge to ease us.

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,790
She has a slide that takes care of the height.

53
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:09,320
So if you come through a chill wind at CSX and such for height you find out the high comments and you

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:16,090
can see we can have edge with the size of the height and edge too in this case is zero point five Ram.

55
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,480
So it's just like wait and see SS but it's pretty quick.

56
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,660
So now I have a class of etch 2.

57
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,780
I'm gonna give this a with of four which is a width of one hundred percent.

58
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:38,580
And again you can check out the till we say SS 5 4 with and you'd see we have we've of auto p x 1 and

59
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,170
the one I'm using right now is for y down here which is 100 percent.

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,150
So with W full which means means with 100 percent.

61
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,190
And then I'm just gonna say be off good.

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,330
And this means background color of good and you can see we have the go top border right there.

63
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,040
And I think this should be called light because it looks a little lighter.

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,560
OK.

65
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,480
So just like that.

66
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,040
That's our top model without waiting any line of CSX.

67
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,680
Really flexible.

68
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,550
Next we have this section that has the logo and the two buttons.

69
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:21,410
So we probably want to have a bar of four with a bit of padding on the edges.

70
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:29,250
So what we're going to do is have a diff class is going to be off with form.

71
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:40,150
The height is going to be of twelve we can check height to see what twelve is and two of his three room.

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,290
So we can play around with those values to make sure we have the correct one edge of twelve.

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,980
Let's just give this a border so that we can see what we are dealing with.

74
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,630
So butter gives us a bottle of one piece so solid and what I read gives is color of red.

75
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,510
So that's the border there.

76
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:05,400
So we can see the dimensions we are dealing with now to be able to control the items in this container.

77
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:14,100
I'll give this a display of flex and items center which means a line item center and justified content

78
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,680
center to just weigh the content center.

79
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,410
Then I'm going to have a def for the logo for.

80
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,210
So for start Jess in this case I'll just call it man.

81
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,810
MELVIN OK.

82
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,530
Because it's the Melvin stock and you can see it's justified center but we don't want to just fight

83
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:40,770
sent out what we want we actually just fight between so that we're going to have two days or two children

84
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,390
and they're going to be floated to each end of the Flex container.

85
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,640
So I'm going to add another child and in here we're going to have a navigation links.

86
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,020
So I'll just cut out the Walton links that we have here and it here and great.

87
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,930
So you can see we have a fiber content between walking perfectly.

88
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,290
We have never.

89
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,230
And then we have the logging register.

90
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:10,400
It looks like this container actually has a very large putty just like in the styling here.

91
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,760
So let's add that buddy.

92
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,130
So let's give this a padding ex of twelve and maybe 12 is a lot.

93
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,580
Let's try six and six looks great.

94
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,540
So putting X which means horizontal padding of six.

95
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,880
Now it looks like the color of the logo should actually be good.

96
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,050
So we are going to say text gold and great.

97
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,620
Now the color of the logging unregistered buttons are actually brown.

98
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,680
So we are going to make sure this is text brown and gray.

99
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,240
That looks fine.

100
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,740
I would give the same class to the register and we also do not want it to be underlined.

101
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,240
So we'll give this a class of no on the line.

102
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,380
Make sure we give this the same class.

103
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,520
And we probably want to change this to sign in and change these to join now just like it is in our template.

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,290
Now the register button actually has a border.

105
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:22,150
So let's give this a border and we we're also going to give this a border broad so that the border isn't

106
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,560
Brown.

107
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:29,320
Just like in the template but the border here looks so thin and in the template it looks thicker.

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,920
So we'll give this a mother of two and I think that's good.

109
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,630
Now it also has a potty.

110
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,330
So we're going to see p. five and that's a little too much.

111
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:47,880
So let's try P. of two and I think that's a K. maybe try P. of one and I think that's perfect.

112
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,010
So now that we have the putting the next thing is to make it round so we're going to see round it and

113
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,950
this guess is of small but outrageous.

114
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,950
We're going to give it one that fool for a complete butter reduce and I think that's great.

115
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:12,250
Now let's get rid of the body red since we had done in the element and now we need to give a little

116
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,250
space between the joint now and the signing.

117
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:24,680
So we are going to come to the signing of the joint now and give this a margin left of three and great.

118
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,370
That's the speech we need it.

119
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:36,420
Finally we need to make sure the text right here for start Jess Mearns Stata is centralized so we have

120
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:45,630
to actually come to the home page which is here and make sure we add that text we don't yet have a home

121
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,620
component.

122
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,570
So let's create one.

123
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:56,970
So at home the view and in the wilds I'm going to import home

124
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,610
from Page's home that view and add that Welch

125
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,170
and in the home we define our template on Def OK.

126
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,670
So the home looks good.

127
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,450
Now let's give this an etch one of Texas Center.

128
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:30,330
So X on the text center the text Brown.

129
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,790
And this is going to see an easy end.

130
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,470
Great.

131
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,360
But now we also need some spacing from the top.

132
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:52,390
So let's give this a glass of margin y 32 and this is of margin top and bottom of 32 units.

133
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:59,320
So if you want to make sure or know what to do two stands for you can concerto in such for margin and

134
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,830
then check out the 32 value you can see that that's 8 REM.

135
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,420
Okay.

136
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,870
So that's it using Tobin's yeses.

137
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a really really easy process to design exactly what we need.

138
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,910
So thank you so much.

139
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,140
And then the next lesson will continue having fun with these projects.
