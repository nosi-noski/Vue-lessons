1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:08,820
Let's install a web server so that we can serve our client side directly from our server side npm install

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,780
safe def where part def middleware

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,530
with this middleware we agreed to serve our client site and I'll show you exactly how our server indexed

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,610
suggests which import these middleware

5
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,540
and I'll also import Rep. Mark

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,520
and I'm also going to import the wetback config.

7
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,970
We'll create the compiler

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,790
and we do this by calling wetback with the wetback config.

9
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:04,350
Then we use the middleware to use my dad for me to where I will pass in the compiler.

10
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,020
And what happens is every time we launch our server the weapon gets me to where he's going to use the

11
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,660
configurations from wetback which is this compiler to launch our client site.

12
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,820
If we want NPM on Def

13
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,070
we haven't ever seen what package notifying.

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,390
That's because here with a capital letter and once it's compiler it you can see we have load money on

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:37,570
in here and we also have web compiling successfully which means I express over a serving with the clients

16
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,470
but for us to be able to actually view something in a browser.

17
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,580
We need to pass contributions to the Web by the way.

18
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,640
The first thing we need is actually an index that is gem of file.

19
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,630
This is going to serve as the template for our client site.

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,970
This is going to be called and easy in the title and here for now I'm just going to have an S-1 that

21
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,520
sees the MTV end project.

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:13,680
Next we're going to use the app there just create here in our index that is GMO so secret sauce is going

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,000
to be equal to the Jess so that every time weapon builds this Abdul Jess file it's going to dump the

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,170
contents in the after Jess and index that extra noise when you use the new version and finally in our

25
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:35,400
server every time the user makes a guess request to our application which is unknown to start I'm putting

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,930
this after I've registered all of my votes so this is a wild card.

27
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:51,020
Well what is going to happen is we're going to response that sent file past the resolve then the oblique

28
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,150
slash index that is Gemma lets you spot the top

29
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,830
and we are instructing Xpress to always respond with the public slash in next load estimate.

30
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,190
When the user makes a request to an unknown world and our client site is going to handle the client

31
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,290
side bouncing from its end so let's visit our application.

32
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,840
We have an error that sees response is not defined and that's because in this world we have to receive

33
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:29,030
requests and response objects Loman restarts web views.

34
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,830
If we refresh we have the MDA and projects.

35
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,320
Why.

36
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,600
Because Express has been instructed to respond with the index of extra Jomo Fry every time an unknown

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,620
world is assessed.

38
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,350
In this case the Homeworld is on.

39
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,570
If we view the beach source you can see we have the app just creeps right there which is the result

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,510
of wetback building the planned site assets.

41
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,270
So as we build along all of our client side assets are going to be in the apologist file and wetback

42
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,670
is going to continue putting the contents here and we agreed to view the changes in that bottom line.

43
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,300
Make sure you have this sets up now catch in in the next lesson.
