1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,890
Let's sort of view Walter.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,940
In this lesson first we're going to install it npm install safe you.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,440
Walter

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:24,900
next in our clan folder we're going to have a routs the Jess file here would import Walter from view

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,350
Walter and we are going to export default.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:28,830
Walter

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,340
in here we're going to make sure the mode is history so that we get rid of the hash value into your.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,240
Oh and we're also going to define an array of what's before we define outs.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,370
Let's come to our index Digest which is our root.

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:59,060
Make sure we import water from wells and past the water as an option to the new view instance.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:09,420
And also we have to import water from view Walter and register it with our view for instance.

12
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,320
So view the use.

13
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,340
Walter and this is going to register a bunch of components that we can use everywhere in application

14
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,290
like the Walter view and Walter link.

15
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,970
So in our vaults we don't yet have any pages.

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,100
Let's go ahead and create a sample page.

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:35,020
This is going to be logging the view and another sample page register that you have a template

18
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,610
that says you stop.

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,320
And in this one the template is going to say logging in our main dot view.

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,000
We are going to have a DPH and this is going to act as the parents.

21
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:03,740
So in here we are going to render the Walter view component if we want to have navigation links.

22
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,370
We can have the water link component

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,960
and this is going to go to logging.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,860
So we'll pass to you she calls you off logging will have one for register

25
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,820
now that we have to Walter links for the logging on ready stoppages will register the logging and register

26
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:38,350
us first our import logging from slash client slash pages slash logging.

27
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:44,680
And the reason why I have out here is because in my bible I'll see if I have an alias for art we probably

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,260
want to add an alias for pages so pages.

29
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,050
This is going to be client slash pages.

30
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:01,690
And in the rules file we can just see pages slash logging here we can register what the path is going

31
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,710
to be of logging on the components it's going to be logging.

32
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:16,870
One more for the registrar of register and component register bool import register form.

33
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,390
Pages slash register.

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:27,080
Now if we visit our application probably want to restart your server NPM on Def

35
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,170
we have an error that says can't resolve pages slash logging.

36
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,970
And that's because we don't view fires we actually need the extension.

37
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,290
So logging that view and now we're back on power successfully.

38
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:49,010
If we refresh the page we have the logging and register pages right there so we can see our water walks

39
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,700
correctly.

40
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,650
We've successfully installed our water.
