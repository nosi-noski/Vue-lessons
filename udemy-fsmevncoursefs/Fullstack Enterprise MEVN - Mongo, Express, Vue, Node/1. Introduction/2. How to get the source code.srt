00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,510
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,500
In this lesson I will show you how to get the source code for all the lessons in this course.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,300
This is the link to the github repository is going to be available to you when you visit the github

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,360
repository.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,930
The first thing you want to do is click on this 41 one comments right here and here you're going to

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,690
see a list of all the comments I made.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,240
Now each committee represents a specific lesson in the cost.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,880
So if I go to order you can see we have less than 1 initialize project and install bubble.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,200
When you click on this comment you would see the five changes that I made in less than one and only

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,290
the five changes I made in this one.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,080
So here we installed a new express server.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,900
We installed the packages we need two sets of bubble.

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,740
We also created Ababa ANSI file.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,460
You can see cleanly the changes I made.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,680
Now let's go back and then let's go back to NEW.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,560
And maybe we want to see the changes made in less than 40 with tweaks so you can see we installed a

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,330
flash plugin a flash Makes in we registered the mixing.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,600
You can see we flashed messages.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,190
We created a flash mix in right here.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,400
We also create at a flash module for the view store and all of that good stuff.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,560
We also installed a package to generate one dorm I.D. for flash messages.

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,710
So this is exactly how you get the source code.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,490
Now if you want to run the project locally you just need to clone or download.

24
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,130
And once you do that the next step is for you to create a dot entry file.

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,740
Now dot even referrals help us keep secrets in application.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,460
Now I want you to place a dot in the file in your projects.

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:44,890
So after downloading then you're going to create a dot in the file and provide the app your oh the database

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,940
your oh the mail user name and the mail password.

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,410
So this is for M. Trump to function correctly.

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,980
So you can receive mail trap that Io.

31
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,770
And then once you visit M. Trump you visit back coder or sorry you visit your own accounts and then

32
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,620
you can create a new inbox where you're going to get the mail credentials so you can see my mail credentials

33
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,340
like you.

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,720
So once you get those you provide exactly what we have here.

35
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:17,290
So you provide yours not mine and you provide a JWT secret for encrypting the GW cheese from the application.

36
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,980
You also provide your database you are often the woods me.

37
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,210
Now this can be for Mongo lap or you can also provide a lucario or just like I did.

38
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,680
Now once you do that you just need to run npm install and you are good to go.

39
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,650
The project is going to run successfully.

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,590
All right.

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,330
Thank you.

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,750
And see you in the next lesson.
